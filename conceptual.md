- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?


Client-side requests (via AJAX):
  You can do easily using AJAX libraries
  Donâ€™t have to involve Flask in the API
  Can be faster: browser could talk directly to, say, Google Maps

Server-side requests:
    Same-Origin Policy may prevent browser requests
    Easier for server to store/process the data
    Need password to access API


- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?

CSRF Token:
    This is generated by the server when a form is shown
    It is included in the HTML of the form

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
 It generates a hidden field that includes a token that is used to protect the form against CSRF attacks
